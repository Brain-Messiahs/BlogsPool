<h3>Empowering the tribal communities in Chhattisgarh</h3>
<p> Solar Enegie’s journey of enabling solar everywhere is incomplete without the chapter on Chhattisgarh. Located centrally in the dense forests of Chhattisgarh, the tribal community here continues to be a very isolated one that is rendered unreachable due to the lack of infrastructure. For an extended period of time, this place has continued to remain removed from the rest of civilization and all the while these tribal communities have been deprived of basic necessities with absolutely no access to power. Whether building a microgrid from scratch or retrofitting an existing diesel microgrid, we can assist you in developing an optimal solution for microgrid solar systems.  Solar Enegie led a campaign in this region to make solar available in over 400 villages with 10,000+ installations generating over 14,000 kWh of energy per year – making Chhattisgarh a monumental flagship project to reckon with.</p>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>
 Solar Enegie, as part of the projects outlined above, has set up over 100 microgrids solar systems in a phased approach across the many villages spanning the Chhattisgarh forests. This project has posed many challenges such as the accessibility of these villages, acceptance by local community which  Solar Enegie was able to preemptively account for and solve. This has made this particular project a huge success and changed lives of the people in Chhattisgarh. Today it is a tale to tell.</p>

<p>The acceptance by the tribal communities made the successful implementation and execution of microgrid solar systems project by the  Solar Enegie an exemplary example of the flawless execution by the  Solar Enegie team.</p>
